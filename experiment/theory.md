Spot speed is referred to as the instantaneous speed of a vehicle at a point or cross section; however there are two distinctly different methods of determination of spot speeds. 

In the first method, the time, **t (sec)** taken by the vehicle to travel a short distance, **d (m)** is determined. Therefore the speed, **v = (d/t) m/sec**. 

In the second method, the instantaneous speed is measured by a pre-calibrated radar equipment which displays or records the speed in desired units, such as kmph.

In view of these two methods, there are two definitions for the average of a series of spot speed measurements viz.; **'space-mean speed'** and **'time-mean speed'**. 

Space-mean speed represents the average speed of vehicles in a certain road length at any time. This is obtained from the observed travel time of the vehicles over a stretch of the road. Space-mean speed is calculated from the relation:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Vs = 3.6d n/ Σ ti** ,  (i = 1 to n )

where,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vs = space-mean speed, kmph  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d  = length of road or the distance considered, m   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n  = number of individual vehicle observations  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ti = observed travel time, (sec) for ith vehicle to travel the distance d. m

The average travel time of all the vehicles is obtained from the reciprocal of space mean speed.

Time-mean speed represents the speed distribution of vehicle at a point on the roadway and it is the average of instantaneous speed of observed vehicles at the spot. Time-mean speed is calculated from the relation:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Vt = Σ Vi / n** ,  (i = 1 to n )

Where,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vt = time-mean speed, kmp  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vi = observed instantaneous speed of ith vehicle, kmph  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n  = number of vehicles observed

The space-mean speed is slightly lower than the time-mean speed under typical speed conditions on rural highways.

<h4>Use of Spot speed studies </h4>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Spot speed studies are useful in the following aspects of traffic engineering:

  - planning traffic regulations and control measures such as speed limit, etc.
  - design or redesign of various geometric elements of the road. 
  - to decide the design speed of existing or new facilities.
  - in accident studies and preventive measures.
  - study of traffic capacity.
  - to find the speed trends with respect to last several years.
  - to compare the behavior of diverse types of drivers and vehicles under specified set of conditions.
  
<h4>Factors affecting spot speed</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The spot speeds are affected by physical features of the road like pavement width, horizontal curve, sight distance, gradient, summit and valley curves, pavement unevenness, intersections and road side developments. Other factors affecting spot speeds are environmental conditions (like weather, visibility), enforcements, traffic conditions, characteristics of the driver and vehicle and the motive of travel.
