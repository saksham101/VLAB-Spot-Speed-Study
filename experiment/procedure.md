## These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator :-

This Simulator is designed to determine the spot speed of a vehicle.

Step 1:- When the user visits the simulator it will interact with the first page, on top "Aim" will be displayed and below it there are two tabs.

Step 2:- Each tabs have a different heading which is actually a differnt way to determine the spot speed.

Step 3:- When the user clicks on any of them, then it redirect to the respective simulator.

<b> Step 3:-  Stopwatch Method :- </b> 

Step 3.1:- After landing on this page you will notice a empty box of distance and there will be a speed slider with stopwatch on the right hand side.

Step 3.2:- Fill the distance in the box and set some slider value, the slider is used to increase or decrease the moving speed of a vehicle.

Step 3.3:- The speed v is calculated by a distance/time formulae.

Step 3.4:- Note the speed in the below observation table. The total of 16 readings is to be taken, repeat the above steps until total of 16 readings is not filled. To retake the reading there is a restart button which will be popped out each time after the car reaches the destination.

Step 3.5:- To get the different readings student have to change the distance and  speed each time.

Step 3.6:- When the table 1 is completed then we proceed to the table 2 which is also known as Speed Distribution Table. 

Step 3.7:- From the spot speed data of selected sample , frequency distribution table of spot speed is prepared by arranging 
the speed groups covering desired speed ranges such as(10-20 kmph, 20-30 kmph, 30-40 kmph) and the number of vehicle in each speed 
range.

Step 3.8:- The airthmetic mean of the measured speeds is taken as the average spot speed.

Step 3.9 :- After that click the Make a graph Button.

Step 3.10 :- The graph is plotted with the average value of each speed group of vehicle on the X axis and the percentage 
of vehicles in that group on Y axis . The graph is called the frequency distribution graph of spot speeds.

Step 3.11 :- The following graph will have definite peak value of travel speed across the section and this speed is denoted 
as 'modal speed'.

Step 3.12 :- It may be inferred that maximum proportion of vehicles in stream prefers to travel at about this modal speed.

Step 3.13 :- At this point the experiment is ended you can get back to previous screen by clicking on back button located at the top of page.

<b> Step 4:-   Radar Gun Method:- </b>

Step 4.1:- After landing on this page you will notice a empty box of distance and there will be a speed slider with radar gun screen on the right hand side.

Step 4.2:- Fill the distance in the box and set some slider value, the slider is used to increase or decrease the moving speed of a vehicle.

Step 4.3:- The speed V of a vehicle is calculated with the help of a radar gun which is pointed from the back of a vehicle.

Step 4.4:- Note the speed in the below observation table. The total of 16 readings is to be taken, repeat the above steps until total of 16 readings is not filled. To retake the reading there is a restart button which will be popped out each time after the car reaches the destination.

Step 4.5:- To get the different readings student have to change the distance and  speed each time.

Step 4.6:- When the table 1 is completed then we proceed to the table 2 which is also known as Speed Distribution Table. 

Step 4.7:- From the spot speed data of selected sample , frequency distribution table of spot speed is prepared by arranging 
the speed groups covering desired speed ranges such as(10-20 kmph, 20-30 kmph, 30-40 kmph) and the number of vehicle in each speed 
range.

Step 4.8:- The airthmetic mean of the measured speeds is taken as the average spot speed.

Step 4.9 :- Then after Click the Make a graph Button.

Step 4.10 :- The graph is plotted with the average value of each speed group of vehicle on the X axis and the percentage 
of vehicles in that group on Y axis . The graph is called the frequency distribution graph of spot speeds.

Step 4.11 :- The following graph will have defineite peak value of travel speed across the section and this speed is denoted 
as 'modal speed'.

Step 4.12 :- It may be inferred that maximum proportion of vehicles in stream prefers to travel at about this modal speed.

Step 4.13 :- At this point the experiment is ended you can get back to previous screen by clicking on back button located at the top of page.
